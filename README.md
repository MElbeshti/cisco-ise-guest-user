# cisco-ISE-Guestuser-Gui
hi Github Users
Since this is my first post on the GitHub community, I want your help and support
I am creating a small Cisco ise python Code (ISEALLGUser.py) with the following features:

Get a list of three main information from cisco ise guest users (company name, username, id) and save them in sqlite3 DB


as DB 'ise-company1'  created as follow:

CREATE TABLE "company_name" (
	"id"	INTEGER,
	"company"	TEXT,
	"name"	TEXT,
	"ID1"	TEXT,
	PRIMARY KEY("id")
);


then the seconde code (ISEGG.py) is small GUI to enable/disable guest users by Company name.



the cisco ISE guide i use is:


https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/identity-services-engine/215476-configure-ise-guest-accounts-with-rest-a.html 

Cisco ISE 2.4



Anyone welcome to modify the code for enhancement & Optimization.
